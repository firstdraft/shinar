# Claude Instructions

This file contains instructions for Claude.

- Lint with `rubocop -A` before any git commit.
- When writing git commits:
    - Don't mention Claude.
    - Use good style (no more than 50 chars in subject, etc)
- For any task, first look to see if good libraries/gems/packages exist and discuss the pros and cons of using them vs writing our own implementation.
- Use Hotwire (Turbo, Stimulus, etc) when possible.
- When possible, use built-in Bootstrap classes instead of writing custom CSS.
- When writing custom CSS, use built-in Bootstrap variables instead of making up values where appropriate.
